# ImageClassifcation
Image classification project using supervised machine learning.

In this project I built an image classifier to detect whether a cat is a 'Tuxedo' cat or not. I downloaded 140 images, labelled by me, and perform various image augmentations to increase the training data set. I did model selection to select the best algorithm for this binary classification problem and did cross-fold validation to tune the model. The final model, a RandomForestClassifier, achieved an accuracy of around 93 % for this binary target variable problem.
